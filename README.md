# Examine and explore specific areas of focus to enhance the statistical capacity of poor nations, leveraging The World Bank's Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) dataset.
Many developing nations need reliable and accurate statistical data for a diverse range of purposes, such as poverty reduction monitoring and reporting to international aid or donors. However, their limited ability often makes them struggle to produce outstanding and compelling statistical outputs (World Bank, 2021). This project will examine the Word Bankâ€™s Statistical Performance Indicators, to identify what are the strengths and weaknesses of developing countries, those including Low-income, Lower-middle-income, and Upper-middle-income. The insights might assist policymakers, non-profit organizations, and regulators seeking to improve their statistical performance, not only for the above purposes, but also for improving decision-making, driving innovation, and solving complex problems
This project is intended to answer the following questions:
1.	What are the common strong and weak areas that contribute to the SPI of those countries?
2.	What is the trend of each area over the observed period of these interesting countries?
3.	Is the SPI score influenced by other development indicators (such as GDP per capita, Government Effectiveness, and the Human Capital Index (HCI)), and population size? What is its relationship?
4.	If we incorporate the SPI score into the above development indicators, will it be any classifiable group we can observe?

The motivation of this project is to identify the area that needs a specific focus area to accelerate and use the data at its full potential. By doing so, we aim to uncover the strengths and weaknesses of their capabilities. To achieve this objective,  Data exploratory analysis and visualization are used to answer the following questions.

This project aims to examine and explore specific areas of focus to enhance the statistical capacity of poor nations, leveraging The World Bank's Statistical Performance Indicators (SPI) dataset using R program, specifically the R shiny dashboard.

Note: The raw dataset are available to download publicly on World Bank website. This visualization project do not include the data cleaning process. The data presented in this project are already cleaned and created for this specific project only.
